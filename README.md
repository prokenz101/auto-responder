# Welcome to the Auto-Responder!
## This is a small python-ahk script that I made which autoresponds to messages.
## Modules Required: [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and [PyAutoGUI](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/)
It's designed for discord but might work with other apps.

Run the ahk file to start.

Simply press `Alt + F7` to add a response.
It will prompt you for a trigger and then a response.
Then hover over the message and press `F7`.

If you want to delete responses, then press `Shift + F7` and enter the trigger of the response that you want to delete.
